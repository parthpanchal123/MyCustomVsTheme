## Aqua Material 

This is my custom color theme for vs-code. Have been using Material Theme Palenight High Contrast (yeah that's one hell of a name) since a while and I decided to tweak it a bit more (why not) .
If you are a dark theme fan and especially love dark bluish shades you might love it ðŸ’¯

Try it and star the theme if you end up using it ðŸ˜„ ðŸ’¯
